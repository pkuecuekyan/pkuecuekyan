### Hi there 👋. I'm Philipp

- 🔭 I’m a software engineer and [designer](https://pxlcoop.com)
- 📍 I'm based in California
- 👨‍💻 I write a lot of code in Swift, Objective-C, JavaScript and, lately, quite a bit of Python and C++
- 📱🖥️ I have worked on apps and websites for Hearst, Con Edison, Aetna, the Washington Post, and CBS
- 🤳 I created a bunch of [creative and AI apps](https://apps.apple.com/hr/developer/phi-co/id858921731)
- 📸🎬 I also take a lot of pictures and moving pictures and, occassionally, write about it. [Check out some of that work](https://pkuecuekyan.com) if you'd like.
