### Hi there 👋. I'm Philipp

- 🔭 I’m a software engineer and [designer](https://pxlcoop.com).
- 📍 I'm based in California.
- 👨‍💻 I write a lot of code in Swift, Objective-C, JavaScript and, lately, quite a bit of Python and C++.
- 📱🖥️ I have worked on apps and websites for Hearst, Con Edison, Aetna, the Washington Post, and CBS.
- 📸🎬 I also take a lot of pictures and moving pictures and, occassionally, write about it. [Check it](https://pkuecuekyan.com) if you'd like to learn more.
